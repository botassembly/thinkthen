# 0304: One question cache and one batching path

Status: ready for design. Lane claude-2. Plan: `sdlc/planning/cleanup-2026-09-30.md`, rulings 2 to 6.

## Outcome

One engine path serves all ten functions and every surface. It builds backend questions, looks each one up in the cache, packs only the misses into requests, sends them, splits the replies, stores each answer alone with a taken-at time, and returns results in input order with bounded memory.

## Design first

Write ADR 0111. It replaces ADR 0048 item 5 and settles:

- The question key: model, backend address, shared context, and one question as sent. What else changes an answer and so belongs in it.
- How `choose`, `tag`, and `score` quote each record in its own question.
- How `find`, `recognize`, and `relate` map onto question entries.
- The store: one SQLite file or another format. Locking between processes. What happens to per-digest lock files and coalescing.
- Test recordings: the simpler of one store or two, and a converter for old request-level recordings.
- Token and request accounting across only the sent questions.
- Partial replies, refusals that halve a batch, and retries.
- Where the requests-per-minute limit sits.
- Which current code the path deletes: content-cut batching, duplicate schedulers, and the batch paths in `cli`, `public`, and the facade.
- The build order in slices that each land green.

A fresh reviewer returns ACCEPT or findings before any build.

## Retained behavior

Output order, exit codes, the null-versus-failure rule, key secrecy, no key read on replay.

## Proof

Named in the ADR. At least: a batch of 100 records followed by a run of 120 that includes them sends only the 20 new questions, counted on a loopback backend.

## Deferred gaps

Cache clearing and expiry.

## Evidence

- Starts from: ADR 0048, ADR 0055, and the 2026-09-29 mapping of System One calls.
- Keeps: output order, exit codes, null versus failure, key secrecy, no key on replay.
- Changes: the cache key, the store, and one batching path, per ADR 0111.
- Proof: named per slice in ADR 0111.
- Defers: cache clearing and expiry.
