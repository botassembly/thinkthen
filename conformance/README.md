# Shared conformance cases

`cases.json` is the language-neutral behavior contract for the command, the Rust library, later language bindings, and database extensions. Every surface reads the same cases. The file fixes one canonical backend URL, question grammar, exact System One request bytes, decoded answers, bare values, detailed request identities, host-neutral bulk results, and the six public error kinds.

A successful exchange has one of two provenance values. `captured` names a committed public recording whose request and response match the embedded exchange exactly. `synthetic_contract` says the exchange was written against the accepted wire contract. Fault cases name deterministic injection points. They are schema contracts until the private engine runner lands with the one-crate merge.

The mixed `annotate` case keeps successful `decide`, `choose`, `score`, and `tag` answers together in one request. The separate partial case keeps three good answers, distinguishes one valid `null` answer from one failed answer, checks the exact failure marker and count, and keeps the logical request identity. The two-group case fixes aggregate request identity in question-set group order.

`rank` expectations name zero-based input indexes in output order beside their yes probabilities. `find` expectations name the selected zero-based input index, or `null`, and list every candidate probability in input order. Its `none` candidate appears last with a null index. A host maps these indexes back to its own container.

The pure-core integration test validates this file offline through the production question grammar, request encoder, response decoder, digest, answer rules, ranking, and find selector. It does not call a command or a network service.

`backend-profiles.json` adds the shared limit and calibration cases. Its exact edges cross the production profile parser and request encoder. It covers evidence bytes, request bytes, expanded tags, grouped annotate, equal and differing names, and either absent name.

`record-values.json` fixes the host-neutral default bulk row. Typed records and bare values cross the production serializer. Command-line framing stays in compiled binary tests.
